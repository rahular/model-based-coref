Gin was developed based on the older Dutch liquor, jenever, and became popular in Great Britain (particularly in London) when William of Orange became King William III of England. Gin today is produced in subtly different ways, from a wide range of herbal ingredients, giving rise to a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with botanical/herbal, spice, floral or fruit-flavours or often a combination. It is most commonly consumed mixed with tonic water.

During his four years there he was given sixteen varsity letters, including ones for boxing, as well as being the captain of the football team. Kenneally joined the NFL in 1926 with the Pottsville Maroons of Pottsville, Pennsylvania.   After his rookie season, he was chosen as the team's captain and was also named to his first All-Pro Squad in 1927, as well as in 1928.

Early critics assigned the authorship of the play to Beaumont and Fletcher, Philip Massinger, Thomas Middleton, William Rowley, Thomas Dekker, John Webster, James Shirley, and even Ben Jonson, in diverse combinations. The most common view is that the play is a work originally by Fletcher and Francis Beaumont, later revised by Massinger.

His early life was spent at Croydon, but it is not certain whether he was educated at Oxford or Cambridge. It may be presumed that he took his degree, as he uses the title of 'Syr' in his translation of Sallust's Bellum Jugurthinum, and in his will he is called Doctor of Divinity.

Other fields of law, such as administrative law, intellectual property law, arms control law, insurance law, environmental law, criminal law, and commercial law, are also integrated within space law. The origins of space law date back to 1919, with international law recognizing each country's sovereignty over the airspace directly above their territory, later reinforced at the Chicago Convention in 1944. The onset of domestic space programs during the Cold War propelled the official creation of international space policy (i.e. the International Geophysical Year) initiated by the International Council of Scientific Unions. The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, directly spurred the United States Congress to pass the Space Act, thus creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Because space exploration required crossing transnational boundaries, it was during this era where space law became a field independent from traditional aerospace law.

Physical whole-body warm-ups help prepare a singer or actor's body in many ways. Muscles all over the body are used when singing/acting.   Stretching helps to activate and prepare the large muscle groups that take care of balance and posture, and the smaller muscle groups that are directly involved with breathing and facial articulation.

It was fought by a French army commanded by Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9 and a combined Dutch-Imperial-Spanish force led by William of Orange. While a clear French victory, both sides suffered heavy losses and it had little impact on the outcome of the war in the Low Countries. Seneffe was one of three battles in the Spanish Netherlands during the Franco-Dutch War and the only one unconnected to a siege, the dominant form of warfare in the late 17th century; Cassel in 1677 was an attempt to relieve Saint-Omer, while Saint-Denis in 1678 was fought to prevent the fall of Mons. In the 1667\u20131668 War of Devolution, France captured most of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comt\u00e9 but relinquished the bulk of these gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle with the Triple Alliance of the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden. Angered by what he viewed as ingratitude for previous French support, Louis XIV decided to attack the Dutch; he weakened his opponents by paying Sweden to remain neutral, and signing an alliance with England in the 1670 Treaty of Dover. In May 1672, French forces invaded the Dutch Republic and initially seemed to have achieved an overwhelming victory but by late July, the Dutch position had stabilised.

Sell-side research is often used as 'soft money' rather than sold directly, for example provided to preferred clients in return for business. It is sometimes used to promote the companies being researched when the sell-side has some other interest in them, as a form of marketing, which can lead to conflicts of interest.   The buy-side is sometimes considered more prestigious, professional, and scholarly, while the sell-side may be higher-paid and more like a sales and marketing role.

Although Rowling says she found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the way in which a person's character is the result of the person's choices. Several commentators have noted that personal identity is a strong theme in the book, and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-human, non-magical and non-living people.", "entities": [{"ent_name": "J.

It claimed that the debt had been owed to a previous regime. France was also outraged over the Jay Treaty and that the United States was actively trading with Britain, with whom they were at war. In response France authorized privateers to conduct attacks on American shipping, seizing numerous merchant ships, and ultimately leading the U.S. to retaliate.

Like a piano, it generates sound using keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal tines, which are then amplified via an electromagnetic pickup which is plugged into an external keyboard amplifier and speaker. The instrument evolved from Rhodes' attempt to manufacture pianos to teach recovering soldiers during World War II under a strict budget, and development continued throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Fender started marketing the Piano Bass, a cut-down version of the piano, but the full-size instrument did not appear until after the sale to CBS in 1965. CBS oversaw mass production of the Rhodes piano in the 1970s, and it was used extensively through the decade, particularly in jazz, pop, and soul music. It fell out of fashion for a while in the mid-1980s, principally due to the emergence of polyphonic and later digital synthesizers, especially the Yamaha DX7, and partly through inconsistent quality control in production due to cost-cutting measures. The company was eventually sold to Roland, which manufactured digital versions of the Rhodes without authorization or approval from its inventor. In the 1990s, the instrument experienced a resurgence in popularity, resulting in Rhodes re-obtaining the rights to the piano in 1997.", "entities": [{"ent_name": "Jazz", "ent_id": "Q8341"}, {"ent_name": "Piano", "ent_id": "Q5994"}, {"ent_name": "Pop music", "ent_id": "Q37073"}, {"ent_name": "Roland Corporation", "ent_id": "Q848490"}, {"ent_name": "Tuning fork", "ent_id": "Q201898"}, {"ent_name": "World War II", "ent_id": "Q362"}, {"ent_name": "CBS", "ent_id": "Q43380"}, {"ent_name": "Rhodes piano", "ent_id": "Q743659"}, {"ent_name": "Soul music", "ent_id": "Q131272"}, {"ent_name": "Electric piano", "ent_id": "Q1136507"}, {"ent_name": "Yamaha DX7", "ent_id": "Q139300"}, {"ent_name": "Fender Musical Instruments Corporation", "ent_id": "Q175391"}, {"ent_name": "Pickup (music technology)", "ent_id": "Q572648"}, {"ent_name": "Harold Rhodes (inventor)", "ent_id": "Q708613"}, {"ent_name": "Cost-cutting", "ent_id": "$missing$"}, {"ent_name": "Keyboard amplifier and speaker", "ent_id": "$missing$"}], "qas": {}, "a1": {"para_ann": [["1232", "which", "company"], ["1321", "its", "rhodes piano"], ["139", "which", "rhodes piano"], ["209", "it", "rhodes piano"], ["29", "as", "fender rhodes piano"], ["313", "which", "metal tines"], ["368", "which", "electromagnetic pickup"], ["851", "it", "rhodes piano"], ["938", "It", "rhodes piano"]], "q_ann": {}}}, "2e3581c741804fa59ae43f3455fbd6aa": {"title": "Robert Borden", "paragraph": "Sir Robert Laird Borden, GCMG PC KC (June 26, 1854\u00a0\u2013 June 10, 1937) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the eighth prime minister of Canada, in office from 1911 to 1920.

In October 2002 the Taiwanese Mandopop boy band F4 and their label Sony Music Taiwan encountered controversy when South Korean media noted the similarities between the 'Love and Remember' and F4's song 'Everywhere' (\u4f60\u4e0d\u611b\u6211\u611b\u8ab0?) from the album Meteor Rain.", "entities": [{"ent_name": "F4 (band)", "ent_id": "Q713438"}, {"ent_name": "Revised Romanization of Korean", "ent_id": "Q498721"}, {"ent_name": "The First Noel", "ent_id": "Q686012"}, {"ent_name": "Universal Music", "ent_id": "$missing$"}, {"ent_name": "Danny Ahn", "ent_id": "Q484387"}, {"ent_name": "Inkigayo", "ent_id": "Q485889"}, {"ent_name": "Music Bank (TV series)", "ent_id": "Q130976"}, {"ent_name": "Meteor Rain (album)", "ent_id": "Q6823437"}, {"ent_name": "Hangul", "ent_id": "Q8222"}, {"ent_name": "Music programs of South Korea", "ent_id": "Q18378451"}, {"ent_name": "Chapter 2 (g.o.d album)", "ent_id": "Q16165970"}, {"ent_name": "Love and Remember", "ent_id": "Q51845573"}], "qas": {}, "a1": {"para_ann": [["171", "It", "love and remember"], ["201", "their", "g.o.d"], ["337", "anyone", "$no_ref$"], ["344", "who", "$no_ref$"], ["369", "someone", "$no_ref$"], ["377", "they", "$no_ref$"], ["446", "one", "$no_ref$"], ["450", "who", "$no_ref$"], ["527", "they", "$no_ref$"], ["617", "It", "love and remember"], ["639", "both", "music bank (tv series)"], ["639", "both", "inkigayo"], ["724", "their", "f4 (band)"], ["91", "as", "$no_ref$"]], "q_ann": {}}}, "73ab3c32b7c94d288eaa98d8a7696ab3": {"title": "The Mosque of Cordoba", "paragraph": "This article refers to the Urdu poem by Muhammad Iqbal.

It has been described as 'one of his most famous pieces' and a 'masterpiece'. It has also been compared to Ahmad Shawqi's Arabic poem Siniyyah for its locating in Islamic Spain 'the embodiment of the ideal, non-territorial Islamic nation' that is, in both poems' world-views, 'the source of world history. ' Iqbal travelled to England in 1931 to participate in the second and third Round Table Conferences in London.   He returned to India via Spain (as well as France and Italy), and it was at this time that he visited the eponymous mosque, though by that time it had long since been converted to a cathedral.   Nevertheless, it was at what has been described as one of the 'high points of his emotional life' that he composed the majority of the poem, as its subtitle clearly indicates: The visit must indeed have inspired him, as the resultant poem is one of the very few occasions in which Iqbal praises art or architecture.
