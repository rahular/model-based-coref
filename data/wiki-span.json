Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, all of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles, that revolve around juniper as a common ingredient. From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, the drink has evolved from a herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin was developed based on the older Dutch liquor, jenever, and became popular in Great Britain (particularly in London) when William of Orange became King William III of England. Gin today is produced in subtly different ways, from a wide range of herbal ingredients, giving rise to a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with botanical/herbal, spice, floral or fruit-flavours or often a combination. It is most commonly consumed mixed with tonic water. Gin is also often used as a base spirit to produce flavoured gin-based liqueurs such as, for example, Sloe gin, traditionally by the addition of fruit, flavourings and sugar.", "entities": [{"ent_name": "Gin", "ent_id": "Q959362"}, {"ent_name": "Liqueur", "ent_id": "Q178780"}, {"ent_name": "Middle Ages", "ent_id": "Q12554"}, {"ent_name": "William III of England", "ent_id": "Q129987"}, {"ent_name": "Tonic water", "ent_id": "Q237315"}, {"ent_name": "Sloe gin", "ent_id": "Q1972926"}, {"ent_name": "Herbalism", "ent_id": "Q861699"}, {"ent_name": "Juniperus communis", "ent_id": "Q26325"}, {"ent_name": "Jenever", "ent_id": "Q80680"}, {"ent_name": "Liquor", "ent_id": "Q56139"}, {"ent_name": "Juniper berries", "ent_id": "$missing$"}, {"ent_name": "Alcohol industry", "ent_id": "Q3150593"}], "qas": {}, "a1": {"para_ann": [["122", "one", "gin"], ["165", "all", "origins"], ["165", "all", "styles,"], ["165", "all", "flavour profiles"], ["219", "that", "$no_ref$"], ["247", "as", "$no_ref$"], ["276", "its", "gin"], ["35", "that", "$no_ref$"], ["48", "its", "gin"], ["856", "It", "gin"], ["862", "most", "$no_ref$"], ["932", "as", "$no_ref$"], ["989", "such", "$no_ref$"], ["994", "as", "$no_ref$"]], "q_ann": {}}, "a2": {"para_ann": [["122", "one", "$no_ref$"], ["165", "all", "gin"], ["219", "that", "gin"], ["247", "as", "$no_ref$"], ["276", "its", "gin"], ["35", "that", "gin"], ["48", "its", "gin"], ["856", "It", "gin"], ["862", "most", "$no_ref$"], ["932", "as", "$no_ref$"], ["989", "such", "addition of fruit"], ["989", "such", "flavourings"], ["989", "such", "sugar"], ["994", "as", "$no_ref$"]], "q_ann": {}}}, "3HRWUH63QUKXJARO4Z9QWUNDNWO5N7": {"title": "Camera", "paragraph": "A camera is an  optical instrument to capture still images or to record moving images, which are stored in a physical medium such as in a digital system or on photographic film.
